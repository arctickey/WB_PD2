### WstÄ™p

The reproducibility of science paper is a huge and important problem. Today we wont to talk about one part of that problem. What If? after publishing article researchers still develop their packages changing function, optimize, etc. In the discussed article researcher focused on this particular situation. They selected articles where used package was still developed until today and check reproducibility. Thay use code in the selected article and check if it is possible to run it today. You will be surprised how many levels of reproducibility can be distinct.t

### What have we learned?

After presenting the research methodology, the authors present its result. The most informative summary is the plot shown below.

We can clearly see that most of the examined articles are fully or mostly reproducible. This is very good news. We are informed that 93.4% of code chunks worked well enough to not throw errors. On the other hand, only 6.6% of them were completely irreproducible. Let's remind that all articles are at least 10 years old! Authors highlighted that their research concerns only packages that are still updated. We cannot say that all 10 years old articles are reproducible. Evolution of packages usually haven't changed their main aims of usage but rather added new features or functions. The biggest troubles were caused by missing of external data or changes in R language itself. To sum up authors claim that examined packages were mostly fully backwards compatible, what should make us happy.
