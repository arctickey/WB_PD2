### Abstract

Missing observations in datasets used in machine learning models is a common and difficult problem. Most implementations of machine learning models, available in popular packages, are not prepared to deal with missing values. This requires user pre-processing of data. There are many suggestions to deal with this problem. Some solutions have been automated and are offered in publicly available packages for the R language. In our study, we tried to compare the quality of different methods of data imputation and their impact on the performance of machine learning models.\

### Introduction and Motivation

#### Definition of missing data

In the field of machine learning, one of the key objects is the data set. Real-world data are often incomplete, which prevents the use of many algorithms. Before creating a machine learning model, it is essential to solve the problem of missing observations. At the beginning, claryfing the definition of missing data is necessary. Missing data means that one or more variables have no data values in observations. This can be caused by various reasnons, which we can formally define as follows:

- MCAR (Missing completely at random)\
Values are missing completely at random if the events that lead to lack of value are independent both of observable variable and of unobservable parameters. The missing data are simply a random subset of the data. Analysis performed on MCAR data is unbiased, howewer data are rarely MCAR.
- MAR (Missing at random)\
Missingness of the values can be fully explained by complete variables. In other words, missing data are not affected by their characteristic, but are related to some or all of observed data. This is the most common assumption about missing data.
- MNR (Missing not at random)\
When data are missing not at random, the missingness is related to the characteristic of variable itself.

#### Techniques of dealing with missing data

In case of preparing a data set for machine learning models we can generally distinguish two approaches. The first method is **omission**. From the data set we can remove observations with at least one missing value or we can remove whole variables where missing values are present. This strategy is appropriate if the features are MCAR. However, it is frequently used also when this assumption is not met. It is also useless when the percentage of missing values is high. The second approach is **imputation**, where values are filled in the place of missing data. There are many methods of imputation, which we can divide into two groups. **Single imputation** techniques use information of one variable with missing values. Popular method is filling missings with mean, median or mode of no missing values. More advanced are predictions from regression models which are applied on the mean and covariance matrix estimated by analysis of complete cases. The main disadvatage of single imputation is treating the imputed value as true value. This method does not take into account the uncertainty of the missing value prediction. For this reason **multiple imputation** was proposed. This method imputes *k* values, which leads to creating *k* complete data sets. The analysis or model is applied on each complete data set and finally results are consolidated. This approach keeps the uncertainty about the range of values which the true value 
could have taken. Additionally, multiple imputation can be used in both cases of MCAR and MAR data.
